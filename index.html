I write about cybersecurity, tech projects, and whatever I'm learning. 

Typically you'll find me doing any of the following in front of my computer:
- Enhancing my current SOC analyst and web development skillset
- Programming/Scripting with Python, Javascript, Bash, SQL, etc
- Competing in CTF Challenges
- And sharpening my ethical hacking skills via TryHackMe, HackTheBox, BLTO, etc.

Please reach out if you have questions or suggestions.
