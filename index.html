Hi, I'm Vincent. 

Fresh from college, I found myself in a predicament that will sound too familiar to many young graduates in Kenya: slogging through one interview after another with seemingly no success in sight. 

So I put a stop to that torture and began my journey as a digital nomad.

I tried many different things - from freelancing to flipping digital products and cryptocurrency. 

But I only started to figure it out when I ventured into cybersecurity.

It began as curiosity that slowly shifted to learning how real-world threats can be be detected and stopped.

Today I'm getting my hands dirty with tools like Wireshark, Sysmon, SIEM, catching flags and blue teaming.
