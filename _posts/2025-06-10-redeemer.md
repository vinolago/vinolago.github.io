### Overview
![Redeemer](/assets/images/redeemer-pawned.jpg)

This is a lab that focuses on enumerating a Redis server and dumping its database. Itâ€™s rated very easy to exploit. 

Redis is typically used to cache data that is frequently requested for quick retrieval, such as prices. 

### Skills Learned
- Enumerating Redis server 

### Open ports

I start with nmap scan to enumerate open ports. We see that port 6379 is open.

Next, we need to install _redis-cli_ in order to interact with the Redis server. The first option is perfect.
We now have a connection.

Under info, the item with the most interest to us is keyspace. It shows the number of keys and their expiration.
Next we select the database with index 0 using select 0.

Now we can use key * to list keys and get <key> to retrieve the key values (flag).
