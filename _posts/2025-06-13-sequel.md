### Overview

The aim is to enumerate web services on the Sequel machine and infiltrate its database using SQL injection. 

### Enumeration

I started with an nmap scan to find open ports. We see that MYSQL is running on port 3306. This version is 5.5.5-10.3.27-MariaDB-0+deb10u1.

That information is vital because it tells me to install either mysql or MariaDB and use the cli commands to try and manipulate this database.

### Access 

According to the manual (--help), we can authenticate to MYSQL service using username and password. 

So, we can try different password/username combinations (time consuming) or try a passwordless option using /root user (only works if mysql database is misconfigured).

Just like that, we’ve gained a foothold.

Now let’s execute some commands and retrieve the flags:
 - SHOW databases; - Prints out the databases we can access
 - USE {database_name}; - Select the database we want
 - SHOW tables; - Shows the available tables inside the current database
 - SELECT * FROM {table_name}; - Reveals all data in the table
