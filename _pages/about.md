## ðŸ”“ Welcome to My Cybersecurity Blog

Typically, you'll find me doing any of the following in front of my computer:

 - Enhancing my current SOC analyst and web development skillset
 - Programming/Scripting with Python, Javascript, Bash, SQL, etc
 - Competing in CTF Challenges
 - And sharpening my ethical hacking skills via TryHackMe, HackTheBox, BLTO, etc.

Here's is where I share most of what I've learned. Please reach out if you have questions or suggestions.
