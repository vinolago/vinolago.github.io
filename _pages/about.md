## ~/Whoami

I’m not the quickest with exploits, nor the loudest in the war room. But I pay attention, to the logs ignored, the alerts dismissed, the anomalies hidden in plain sight.

While others rush to patch or scan, I study the behavior, thinking critically and spotting patterns in the noise.

I enjoy getting my hands dirty and going down the endless rabbit hole.

Every flag I catch, every insight I uncover, it's a reminder that this is a lifelong path, and I’ve only just tuned in.
